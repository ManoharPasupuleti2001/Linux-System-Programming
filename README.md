# Linux System Programming

## Overview
This repository contains resources and examples for learning Linux system programming. System programming on Linux involves writing applications that interact with the operating system kernel and system libraries to perform tasks such as process management, file I/O, inter-process communication (IPC), memory management, and more.

## Contents
1. **Introduction to System Programming**
   - Understanding the basics of system programming and its importance.
2. **Linux System Calls**
   - Explanation and examples of common system calls used for interacting with the Linux kernel.
3. **File I/O Operations**
   - Handling files using system calls like `open`, `read`, `write`, `close`, etc.
4. **Process Management**
   - Creating, managing, and communicating between processes using `fork`, `exec`, `wait`, etc.
5. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**
   - Techniques for communication between processes, including pipes, message queues, shared memory, and semaphores.
6. **Memory Management**
   - Memory allocation and management using system calls such as `malloc`, `free`, `mmap`, etc.
7. **Signals**
   - Handling and responding to signals sent by the operating system or other processes.
8. **Threads and Synchronization**
   - Introduction to threading and synchronization mechanisms like mutexes and condition variables.
9. **Socket Programming**
   - Creating network applications using socket APIs for communication over the network.
10. **Advanced Topics**
    - Advanced concepts such as epoll, poll, select, Linux kernel modules, etc.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManoharPasupuleti2001/linux-system-programming.git
   ```
2. Explore the directories and files containing examples and explanations for different system programming concepts.
3. Follow the README files in each directory for instructions on compiling and running the examples.
4. Experiment with the code, modify it, and observe the changes in behavior.

## Requirements
- Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu)
- C/C++ compiler (e.g., gcc, g++)
- Basic understanding of the C programming language
